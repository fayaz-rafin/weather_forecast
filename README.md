Submission for Local Hack Day: Build 2022 by MLH (weather script made with python)

## What it does
It essentially uses API calls to get data from a weather API and displays the current weather of a city.

## How I built it
I used openweathermap.org's free weather API to get the data of the current weather and weather conditions and coded it with Python.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the challenges i ran into was how to display images of the weather conditions (eg. when it's sunny or cloudy etc.) from the API. Instead, I displayed the current condition as a Text so that the user can understand the current condition of the weather of their desired location.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use an API and make API calls. This was a really fun project and i had a blast making it!

## What's next for weather_forecast.py?
In the future iteration, I will try to add images for this python script instead of displaying the current weather condition as Text.
